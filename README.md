# Custom Risc-v core 

A project to learn basics ideas of designing a chip from start. 
This is meant to be done first in C then in a hardare description language
(Vhdl or Verilog) and the to run on a FPGA.

## Basics ideas : 
- 32 bit processor that can handle demical, floating, vector operations
- out-of-order , 5-stage pipeline, basic memory system 

## Things to implement
| Component                 | C|CPP|PYTHON  | HDL     |
| :---                      |    :----:     |    ---: |
| [x] Float Point Unit(FPU) | [x]           | []      |  
| Paragraph         | Text        | And more      |
- [x] Float Point Unit (Fpu) 
- [ ] Single Po
